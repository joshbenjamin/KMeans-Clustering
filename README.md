Welcome to my solution for the first lab of the CSC3022H course, K-Means Clustering

In order to run this, open a terminal at the root of this project and run the 'make' command

This will then create the linux equivalent of an executable program, which we will run in the next line.

Run the program by typing ./KMeans followed by 3 parameters:
    1: The K number (number of clusters). 3 was used for the example.
    2: The input file with a set of data. data.txt is used for the example.
    3: The output file that will be written to. output.txt was used in my example.
    

You can run it yourself to see the results.
(Note: My final result is different to what I would assume the final result is in the PDF. Also, I assigned points to clusters initially different to the example)
